# [itp-w1] Basic Calculator

Our second group project will be to create a program that acts as a basic four function calculator.

All students will fork this repo and set up their cloud9 for this project individually with guidance from the mentor.

We will want the following interface:

```python
>>> basic_calculator(1, 7, 'add')
'8'
>>> basic_calculator(5, 2, 'subtract')
'3'
>>> basic_calculator(3, 4, 'multiply')
'12'
>>> basic_calculator(12, 3, 'divide')
'4'
>>> basic_calculator(3, 4, 'what')
'Invalid operation'
```
